# automation-test

## Project setup
```
npm install
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Lints and fixes files
```
npm run lint
```

### Things To note
##### /src is the code for the UI
##### /src-tauri is the code for the backend (its where the main function is)

# Big thing to note
#### Since this program requires a lot of external dependencies and is not fully built it can only ran in dev mode and this cannot be run on your system unless you have all the building dependencies. Thus it does not work outside of my enviroment, very sad
